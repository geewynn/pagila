# Pagila Data Pipeline with airflow and Python

- This repo contains a data pipeline project built to load cv data from an aws-s3 bucket to a redshift database cluster. The project was done in two ways.
  - Using only python to build an etl pipeline that takes the csv files from s3 to redshift.
  - Using airflow to create the etl pipeline.
